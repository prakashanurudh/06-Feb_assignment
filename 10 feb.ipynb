    "Ans. 1.  Files are actually a limited resource that are managed not by the language, but the OS itself. Without closing them we may risk reaching and          causing problems with the continued operation of the program. Too many open files will also impact program performance due to                          increased demand on RAM and other OS resources.\n",
    "    2.   Files left unintentionally open become vulnerable to loss of data. If the program or computer crashes unexpectedly, any open files may                not be  recovered despite the OS & languages best efforts to protect data. \n",
    "    3.   Any changes to files done will not be readable until after the files are closed. The OS puts a lock on the open file until closed, thus                useful  applications such as AV scans on files may be hindered. \n",
    "     Finally, it's not best-practice coding style. To limit the amount of potential debugging, and other code issues, remember to close your files. "
